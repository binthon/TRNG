# TRNG (TRUE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR)

# PROJECT GOAL
The goal is to use the mcp3008 a/c converter and to read random voltages from CH0. Then using these voltages to generate a fully random number in the range specified by the user. 
# TECHNOLOGY
The program was written in python along with the libraries spidev (used to communicate with the SPI interface of the Raspberry PI 4), matplotlib, hashlib.
